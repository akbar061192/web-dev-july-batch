What is React?
JS library for building user interfaces
React is not a framework. It is just a library
React is small and not complete for all solutions
You need to depend on other 3rd party lib's to solve any other solutions


Why React?
Flexible
Community support and Investment
Peformance (React uses Virtual DOM)


React- to create ui components
ReactDOM -  take the components and paint/display/show in the ui


React Components
Nothing but a js function
They are re-usable


html --> created html template with elements
js --> link the elements from html file and add event listeners or chaning the text of the html elements


declarative approach --> tell me what i should do. I will do it for you with out any further instructions.

JSX == > html in js
